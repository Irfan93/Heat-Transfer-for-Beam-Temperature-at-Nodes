# Heat-Transfer-for-Beam-Temperature-at-Nodes

## Problem Description : 
### For a beam held at one side to another structure and if that end is to have constant temperature while the open environment is set to another ambient temperature. How does the heat propagates througout the beam and at equilibrium what does the each node point on the beam's temperature will be at. 

## Solution: 
### Solving was done using VBA in the Microsoft Excel, by using Gausion with Pivot method to arrive at matrix solution that gives temperature at each point. Attached is the Excel file embedded with the macro written in VBA.

This repository contains access to two different pdf files that shows the derivation of equations and how to reach the end results for each node
